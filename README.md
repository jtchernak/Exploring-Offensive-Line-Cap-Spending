# Exploring Offensive Line Cap Spending
Noticed an interesting trend in cap spending on offensive lineman as a % of their total cap....

Significantly higher % this year relative to the past 4 years of cap allocation. Perhaps because it is before pre season cuts and fringe players are boosting this number artifically? Will keep an eye on this when 53 man rosters are established. Also broke down % of cap allocation by division using ggplots facet grid feature.

Every team outside NYJ prefers to hover around the 10%-15% range, New York has had significant investment in their offensive line every year outside of 2016. Interesting that MIA has notable jump into the 15%-20% range.

The AFC West likely accounts for a signficant portion of this jump, every team jumped beyond the 20% mark. Oakland's follows their trend of strong investment and it appears Denver is returning to strong investment too. What we can say though is that another two teams, KC and LAC, both left the 10%-15% that they were hovering around.

No real discernible trend among these teams outside of SF being the 10%-15% range but moving beyond that a slight amount, though not to the degree some teams are. We can notice though that after spending below 5% for Seattle and Arizona, they both upped their investment. Possibly they realized that they were spending well below average on the offensive line and receiving below average results.

What stands out here is Dallas, they were due to pay their offensive linemen this year and combined with contracts from last year they are spending above 25% of their cap on offenive linemen. Interesting though that they were in 10%-15% range but had no problem investing in their own players to a high level. NYG is one of the lowest investors in offensive lines over the past few years and what we can see is that after spending below 5% they too upped investment considerably. PHI is a heavy investor in their offensive line every year and that only continues into this year. Perhaps teams noticed the Eagles investing in their offensive line in the 15% to 20% rough range and how it benefited them this past year. Washington has also been a large investor in their offensive line and after a year of low spending they went back to a high level again.
