# Exploring Offensive Line Cap Spending: Interesting trend in investment in offensive line spending this offseason.

## Methodology

Was browsing SPOTRAC's database and noticed that the % of salary being spent on offensive lines was significantly higher than prior years. Salary information is from Spotrac. Data only goes back to 2013 from Spotrac. 

## Analysis

Noticed an interesting trend in cap spending on offensive lineman as a % of their total cap....

Significantly higher % this year relative to the past 4 years of cap allocation. Perhaps because it is before pre season cuts and fringe players are boosting this number artifically? Will keep an eye on this when 53 man rosters are established. Also broke down % of cap allocation by division using ggplots facet grid feature.

## Divisional Breakdown

Every team outside NYJ prefers to hover around the 10%-15% range, New York has had significant investment in their offensive line every year outside of 2016. Interesting that MIA has such a pronounced jump into the 15%-20% range. New England appears to be following a guideline of 10%-15% along with Buffalo.

Baltimore is a team that consistently places in the 10%-15% range every year. The Bengals look like they are a team that invests more than average into their offensive line, 5 of the 6 years in this data they are on the high end of 10%-15% or beyond this area. Cleveland is a heavy investor, they do not follow the conventional range and instead have opted to invest in the high end of the teens and well into the twenties, reaching quarter of cap range almost. Pittsburgh has almost followed a linear trend of continued spending on their offensive line as they are spending slightly above a fifth of their cap on their offensive line.

Houston looks to be on the high end and the low end of 10%-15% with some volatility. Indianapolis has been on the low side of this range until this year, where they are investing almost a quarter of their cap into the offensive line. Trying to keep Andrew Luck healthy anybody? Jacksonville follows the typical 10%-15% range with high end spending recently and one year of slightly more than 15% in 2015. After a few years of low investment Tennessee reverted back to roughly 20% investment into their offensive line. 4 of the previous 5 years they had been in our range of 10%-15% but like other teams they appear to be moving away from it.

The AFC West likely accounts for a signficant portion of this jump, every team jumped beyond the 20% mark. Oakland's follows their trend of strong investment and it appears Denver is returning to strong investment too. What we can say though is that another two teams, KC and LAC, both left the 10%-15% that they were hovering around.

This is a division of change it seems, Chicago has hovered slightly below the 10%-15% range and into the middle of this area but it looks like they changed course and are investing much more into this position grouping. Detroit has consistently been at the low end of 10%-15%, even below it, but show a significant jump to nearly 18% of their cap. Green Bay is a perfect example of 10%-15% range, staying at the high end of the range but this year they moved into the 20% range like other teams. Minnesota is similar except they have not taken the jump out of this range and instead continue to operate between 10%-15%.

This division provides some interesting insight into the recent jump in cap allocation. We can see Atlanta was a team that invested between 10%-15% in their offensive line. This year, however, they have jumped to the league lead at just above 26%, a bit more than a fourth of their cap. In a somewhat similar fashion Carolina has hovered in the 10%-15% for much of the past 6 years outside of 2016, but they upped their spending to the 18% range. New Orleans has typically hovered at the high end of 10% to 15% outside of 2014 but this year they jumped into newfound territory, investing nearly a quarter of their cap into the offensive line. Tampa Bay has generally played in the 10%-15%, though they are somewhat volatile.

No real discernible trend among these teams outside of SF being in the 10%-15% range but moving beyond that a slight amount, though not to the degree some teams are. We can notice though that after spending below 5% for Seattle and Arizona, they both upped their investment. Possibly they realized that they were spending well below average on the offensive line and receiving below average results.

What stands out here is Dallas, they were due to pay their offensive linemen this year and combined with contracts from last year they are spending above 25% of their cap on offenive linemen. Interesting though that they were in 10%-15% range but had no problem investing in their own players to a high level. NYG is one of the lowest investors in offensive lines over the past few years and what we can see is that after spending below 5% they too upped investment considerably. PHI is a heavy investor in their offensive line every year and that only continues into this year. Perhaps teams noticed the Eagles investing in their offensive line in the 15% to 20% rough range and how it benefited them this past year. Washington has also been a large investor in their offensive line and after a year of low spending they went back to a high level again.
