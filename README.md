Significantly higher % this year relative to the past 4 years of cap allocation. Perhaps because it is before pre season cuts and fringe players are boosting this number artifically? Will keep an eye on this when 53 man rosters are established. Also broke down % of cap allocation by division using ggplots facet grid feature.

Every team outside NYJ prefers to hover around the 10%-15% range, New York has had significant investment in their offensive line every year outside of 2016. Interesting that MIA has notable jump into the 15%-20% range.
